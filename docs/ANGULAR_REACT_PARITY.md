# Angular React parity tracker

React is the source of truth for component appearance, interactions, data contracts, options and defaults. Angular implementations stay native; template projection and output events provide Angular equivalents for React nodes and callbacks. Catalog coverage does not establish parity.

Current progress: 6 components have validated baselines and 110 await review. Activity Feed is in [PR #1](https://github.com/chaitanay-kumar/kittu-ui/pull/1). Advanced Data Table is in [PR #2](https://github.com/chaitanay-kumar/kittu-ui/pull/2). AI Agent Activity is in [PR #3](https://github.com/chaitanay-kumar/kittu-ui/pull/3). AI Prompt Composer is in [PR #4](https://github.com/chaitanay-kumar/kittu-ui/pull/4). Loader is in [PR #5](https://github.com/chaitanay-kumar/kittu-ui/pull/5). Each component fix gets its own branch and pull request against `feat/kittu-ui-library`.

User priority: finish simpler components first. AI Response work is preserved on `feat/angular-ai-response-parity` and remains in progress. Button is on `feat/angular-button-parity`. Next quick reviews: Neon Edge Button and Orbital Loading Ring. The original inventory order remains below for tracking, not execution priority.

## Review requirements

- Compare the actual rendered React component and its public types before changing Angular.
- Match data contracts, option names, defaults, state changes, callbacks and content customization.
- Match layout, typography, colors, icons, responsive behavior and interaction feedback.
- Check keyboard operation, focus, disabled/loading/error/empty states, cleanup and reduced motion.
- Use the same demo data and exercise consuming applications, not only the documentation shell.
- Edit authored definitions and regenerate tracked catalogs, exports and source outputs.
- Record test results and remaining differences; mark a component validated only for the coverage recorded in its report.

## Validation baseline

Activity Feed: 14 component browser checks and 24 catalog/navigation checks pass on desktop/mobile Chromium. All 117 existing unit tests pass. The production build passes 289 SEO checks. The packaged contract check passes, and Angular 20.0, 20.3, 21 and 22 consumers compile all 116 selectors with the Activity Feed bindings. Lint has 21 inherited warnings.

These results cover the first component and integration regressions; they do not establish parity for queued components. Physical devices, Safari/Firefox and exhaustive accessibility coverage are outside the recorded validation.

AI Agent Activity: 20 focused browser checks, 24 catalog/sidebar checks, the built-package contract, 117 unit tests, four Angular consumer builds and production build with 289 SEO checks pass. Lint retains 21 inherited warnings. See its report for motion coverage limits.

AI Prompt Composer: 8 focused browser checks, 24 catalog/sidebar checks, packaged async/attachment contracts, four Angular consumer builds, 117 unit tests and production build with 289 SEO checks pass. Lint retains 21 inherited warnings.
